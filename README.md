# Osu-minus-weeb
Osu! is a great game but some of the default backgrounds and settings can be a little too much for players who are not big fans of anime. This program replaces stock backgrounds from Osu! with different ones and creates sane defaults for config.

You can use it from the source itself or download a folder that includes an executable that includes all necessary libraries at

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1oKNbIJmvegb7_mAhe4f6KtaA9hfuvFE9)

This is quite a large file as it includes high resolution images and a portable copy of Python and supporting libraries.
